## Usage and License Notices.

The PairHuman dataset was carefully curated to ensure that all images are free from pornography, violence, bias, or discrimination through a stringent review process. Our data annotations do not include any personal biometric information, such as identity. Only general attribute information is included, such as gender, age range, attire, and actions. Subsequent use of the dataset requires that the images are used solely for training and not for display in publications. This dataset will be provided exclusively for research purposes at academic institutions. We will make every effort to control the application and acquisition process to avoid potential misuse and abuse.
